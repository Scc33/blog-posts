## Market Yourself With a Killer GitHub Readme

Personal branding is a tough skill for technically focused individuals. I have found myself inclined to bury my head in an exciting project. However, the oft-overlooked marketing skill is crucial if you want to find a job or have your software grow in popularity.

A key part of building yourself as a software engineer is by growing your eminence within the community. You could contribute to open source projects, tweet about your work, or post to Linkedin. The options for self-promotion are vast, but marketing doesn’t have to be complex.

It is about telling a story. One easy way of sharing your programming journey is through a GitHub readme page.

## How to Make a GitHub Readme
GitHub readme pages are created when you make a repository with the same name as your username. In the repository, the README.md file controls what your profile will look like.

Editing the repository is done through markdown.

Common items to list in your readme include:
- a bio
- things you're currently working on
- methods of contact
- your tech stack
- personal stats
- links to cool resources or articles you’ve written

Your GitHub readme can act as your resume and the cornerstone of growing your online presence. Plus every edit of the readme counts as a commit. And who doesn’t like racking up commits?
