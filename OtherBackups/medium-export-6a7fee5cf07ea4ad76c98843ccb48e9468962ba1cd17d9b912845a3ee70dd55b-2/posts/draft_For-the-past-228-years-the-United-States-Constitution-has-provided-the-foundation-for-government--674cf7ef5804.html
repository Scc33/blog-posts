The Congress it established has been a bulwark of democracy in the United States. Over the past few political cycles gridlock has developed in this Congress set up by the Constitution, and everyday citizens of the United States turn on the news at night to see politicians unable to make progress due to partisanship. Slowly, growing over the past few decades, the ability to compromise has been compromised. Now today, compromise on every level seems to have become nonexistent and perhaps even impossible because of an unprecedented level of partisanship. The causes of such division and strife have occurred slowly, but over time it has grown into a Congress that is broken in two. Due to fundamental shifts in political strategy, gerrymandering, and the issues that divide us today, Congress has become highly politically polarized resulting in little compromise and low levels of productivity harming the United States.</p><p name="914f" id="914f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Highly politically polarized, the Congress of the modern day is stratified along two very distinct and separate positions. On one side the left leaning Democrats and on the other the right leaning Republicans. Currently the Democratic and Republican parties are “as far apart on issues of public policy as they have been in at least a half-century” (Carsey and Layman). The rise of this political separation has reared its head in the ability of Congress to get work done. A common measure of the productivity of Congress is the number of bills that each Congress passes over its lifetime. The number of bills passed by each Congress has fallen from over 700 bills on average for each Congress in the 1970s to just 329 for the last Congress (govtrack.us). This stunning decline in productivity is assignable to the simultaneous rise in political partisanship. Former Governor of Vermont, Jim Douglas, describes the collapse in political efficacy, “The decline in civil discourse can be attributed in large part to the rise in political polarization.” Political polarization reveals itself in Congress’ inability to be productive. Additionally, the inability of Congress to compromise demonstrates the lack of moderation currently present thus proving the existence of a highly polarized institution.</p><p name="f49b" id="f49b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first cause of the political polarization in Congress is the changing nature of the issues affecting the United States. The intractable nature of the issues that exist today leave little or no room for compromise. Over the past decades the issues affecting America have changed substantially and often these issues are far more complex and unwieldy than ever before. One such example of an unwieldy, difficult, and intractable question is the issue of abortion. Due to the type of issue it is there is little or no room for a middle ground to be taken, one must either be pro-abortion or anti-abortion. Thus when the distinction between the two sides is so black and white compromise becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Other examples besides abortion are climate change, privacy rights, immigration, and homosexual marriage. These issues are polarizing as their very nature allows for little middle ground. T his creates polarization of opinion as people choose sides and by extension political polarization. Moving out beyond an individual level, the party system of the U.S. perpetuates this issue as parties are “policy seeking” meaning that parties translate citizens’ preferences into policy (Weil 2153). With only two parties “policy seeking” they bring only two perspectives which immediately go to each end of the spectrum resulting in little middle ground as each party tries to capitalize on the support from its own side of the spectrum. Applying this concept to the topic of abortion, one side will look to support abortion while the other side will look to ban abortion. The two parties are thus complete opposites and have staked their beliefs on one side so it is difficult for anyone to move to a more middle position because they are locked in by the party. Parties therefore perpetuate and instantiate the political divide caused by these intractable issues creating political polarization. </p><p name="ebee" id="ebee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Secondly Congress has become politically polarized due to a system of gerrymandering. Gerrymandering, the process of setting political districts, often creates districts where only one candidate has the possibility of winning. This is due to political bias. As described by one author, “Gerrymandering has created districts in which the only contest is in the primary. That means two politicians are vying to be the most conservative or liberal with the winner stomping all over the general election opponent” (Bump). As part of its very nature, gerrymandering does not reward moderation because it offers only one party the chance of winning within that district. When only one party can win an election, the election becomes not about winning the approval of the other side and swing voters. Instead it becomes a competition to be the most far out on the political spectrum so that one can win the approval of their own side; therefore, gerrymandering in fact rewards political polarization because that wins elections in gerrymandered districts. Then once the candidate becomes an elected official they need not worry about continually winning again and again because gerrymanders have attempted to pack districts with enough votes so one party will always win (Hill). Thus when a candidate is not threatened by losing an election they need not strike a compromising role so they maintain their far out political position. Compromise plays a crucial role in politics because it acts as a tool of moderation. Without it polarization becomes the most likely path. Therefore through the process of “carving our nation into red and blue one-party fiefdoms” (Hill) gerrymanders have in fact played a major role in engineering political polarization. </p><p name="e910" id="e910" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The final cause of political polarization in Congress is a change in party strategy. Over the past decades there has been a fundamental change in the political strategy of parties. Political parties once tried to win over swing voters to win elections, but this is no longer the case. The political opinion in this country is so evenly split that candidates for political office often have elections going 49–49 with only a small majority winning. In response, the GOP shifted its strategy from trying to win swing votes to trying to mobilize as much of its own base as possible (Hill). Candidates are not looking to draw a large coalition of the electorate to their cause as they once did in the past. Now candidates look for the most effective ways to inspire their own base into voting; therefore, politicians now compete with each other for ideological supremacy and purity as this best motivates political bases. Jim Douglas, the former governor of Vermont, describing his own issues while governing said, “Politicians — on both sides of the aisle — seem to be competing in a contest to see who is the most ideologically ‘pure’” (Douglas 104). Perhaps those politicians that seem pure can motivate the largest majority of their base to reelect them, but it leads to an unyielding nature when it comes to compromise because that would destroy their “pure” position. Without compromise political polarization is greatly exacerbated. On the other hand in the past when candidates looked to swing voters to push them to victory in elections they would strike a more moderate position. This is largely no longer the case as moderate positions have been deemed to not win elections most effectively so instead polarized positions are taken.</p><p name="989a" id="989a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In combination the shift in issues, process of gerrymandering, and the change in political strategy has caused political polarization in the Congress of the United States. By its nature political polarization is crippling the ability of Congress to conduct its business effectively and in a timely manner. This is unacceptable. Congress is tasked with upholding the preamble of the Constitution of the United States for over 300 million citizens. Petty politics should not stand in the way passing laws, ideological purity should not stop compromise, partisanship should not harm the posterity. Political polarization cannot be allowed to be a detriment to our rights as citizens. If this continues then the path of the United States may be significantly less bright then it could be, and that is an egregious wrong.</p><p name="f1ef" id="f1ef" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="c048" id="c048" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="4561" id="4561" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="cfb0" id="cfb0" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="480f" id="480f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="8ab2" id="8ab2" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b1d3" id="b1d3" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="10f6" id="10f6" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="1968" id="1968" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="8423" id="8423" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="dd0f" id="dd0f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b492" id="b492" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="5553" id="5553" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="863a" id="863a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="6f6a" id="6f6a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="92dd" id="92dd" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="fcd7" id="fcd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Works Cited</p><p name="2a8a" id="2a8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Carsey, Thomas, and Geoffrey Layman.
