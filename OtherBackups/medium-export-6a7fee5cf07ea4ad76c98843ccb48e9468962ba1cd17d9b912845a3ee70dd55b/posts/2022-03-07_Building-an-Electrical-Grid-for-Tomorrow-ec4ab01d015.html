The first step on the path to reducing emission is upgrading the electrical grid. Other changes such as electric vehicles are far less effective when they are powered by dirty electricity. In addition to being unsustainable, the current electrical grid is not equipped to handle the needs of tomorrow. Recent events like the rolling California blackouts and the 2021 Texas grid failure have highlighted the tragic consequences of unsustainable grids. Society must recognize this issue and work on solutions. With investments in energy production, storage, and smart grid technologies the power infrastructure of tomorrow can be clean and sustainable with current technologies. To examine the changes that need to be made to the electrical grid, this paper will analyze the makeup of the current grid, sustainable energy production sources, and how those sources can be augmented by storage and smart grid technologies. Finally, this paper will analyze necessary investments and the ethical implications of altering the grid.</p><p name="c811" id="c811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before analyzing possible technologies and investments, it is prudent to first examine the current makeup of power generation in the United States. As of 2020 the United States power grid primarily relies on large, utility-scale electrical production. The total power generation breakdown is 40% natural gas, 19% coal, 20% nuclear, 13% nonhydroelectric renewable (wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass), 7% hydroelectric, and 1% from petroleum and other sources <a href="#_ftn1" data-href="#_ftn1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[1]</a>. While power generation is the most typical way of measuring grid supply, electrical generating capacity is another often cited measure. In terms of electrical capacity, the U.S. has 43% natural gas, 20% coal, 9% nuclear, 16% nonhydroelectric renewable, 9% hydroelectric, and 3% from petroleum and other sources <a href="#_ftn2" data-href="#_ftn2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[2]</a>. Actual production and capacity differ because power plants do not generate at full tilt every hour of everyday. Gas and coal plants are turned down when demand is low or maintenance is required, and renewable generation differs wildly from capacity because of weather fluctuations.</p><p name="32a7" id="32a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regardless of the measurement system used, the U.S. grid is far too reliant on fossil fuels with over 60% of all power coming from gas, coal, and petroleum. These sources are polluting, contributing factors to climate change, and unfeasible for long-term sustainability. The technologies exist to replace these unsustainable sources with sustainable power generation. Renewable and sustainable are often interchanged terms. Johns Hopkins University clarifies the difference by defining sustainable sources as being able to “fulfill our current energy needs without compromising future generations” <a href="#_ftn3" data-href="#_ftn3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[3]</a>. Renewable energy often falls underneath this umbrella, but the more important factor is sustainability.</p><figure name="ea47" id="ea47" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*dJP3vT9ke5hUDn74" data-width="5184" data-height="3456" data-unsplash-photo-id="WYGhTLym344" data-is-featured="true" alt="Wind mills" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dJP3vT9ke5hUDn74"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@appolinary_kalashnikova?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@appolinary_kalashnikova?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Appolinary Kalashnikova</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="3faa" id="3faa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">First, and perhaps the easiest sustainable energy source to consider, is solar power. Photovoltaic modules, otherwise known as solar panels, can convert sunlight into electricity; and there is certainly a tremendous amount of energy to capture. According to MIT professor Washington Taylor the sun provides more than 10,000 times the world’s energy use <a href="#_ftn4" data-href="#_ftn4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[4]</a>. Solar panels have followed a tremendous journey of constant improvements in both efficiency and cost <a href="#_ftn5" data-href="#_ftn5" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[5]</a>. Further advances in the future remain promising achievements to look forward to.</p><p name="3fe5" id="3fe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition to solar power, wind energy is another prominent renewable energy source. Wind energy is prevalent worldwide, with some countries like Denmark sourcing almost half their power from wind energy <a href="#_ftn6" data-href="#_ftn6" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[6]</a>. Wind power has become more efficient overtime as better technologies have come to market. Notably better materials and economies of scale have allowed wind turbines to grow to titanic sizes. Larger wind turbines can generate more electricity, keep prices low, and have higher utilization <a href="#_ftn7" data-href="#_ftn7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[7]</a>. Simply put, larger wind turbines can spin at a greater range of wind speeds and generate more power. Wind power production is suitable for large swaths of the U.S. and regions offshore. These regions are windy and have plenty of open space for the large turbines. The large availability of wind and the decreasing costs have contributed it to growing as a share of U.S. power <a href="#_ftn8" data-href="#_ftn8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[8]</a>. Thanks to economies of scale and technological improvements wind power should continue to decrease in costs.</p><p name="ecdb" id="ecdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Third, hydroelectricity is the oldest form of renewable energy. Human have used the power of flowing water for thousands of years. Unfortunately, there are only so many rivers in the world suitable for damming and generating power. Many of those rivers were low hanging fruit and harnessed long ago. Hydroelectric power grew until the mid-1970s and has since stabilized <a href="#_ftn9" data-href="#_ftn9" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[9]</a>. Additionally, an important consideration is the huge environmental effect that a massive concrete structure can have. When considering the best rivers have already been used and the environmental cost further increases to hydroelectric power seem minor at best.</p><p name="351e" id="351e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, rivers are but one source of moving water on the planet. Three quarters of the Earth’s surface is covered by water which is constantly moving in the form of waves and currents. Using ocean power is a relatively new paradigm for energy generation so it remains an area of ongoing research and development. There are encouraging signs that this area is growing with electricity generation from marine sources rises an estimated 13% in 2019 <a href="#_ftn10" data-href="#_ftn10" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[10]</a>. However, this growth comes off a small base. So, despite the improvement, the technologies required are young and expensive. This remains a key technology to keep an eye on but is not shovel ready.</p><p name="c5e9" id="c5e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fourth energy source to consider is nuclear power. The amount of nuclear energy in the United States has remained roughly constant since the 1990s as popular opinion turned against the energy source <a href="#_ftn11" data-href="#_ftn11" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[11]</a><a href="#_ftn12" data-href="#_ftn12" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[12]</a>. Despite being publicly unpopular, all sustainable energy sources must be evaluated. Since nuclear energy produces no emissions, it is extremely planet friendly. It is also a powerful and dense form of energy. A single one-half inch sized pellet of uranium contains the equivalent energy to an entire ton of coal <a href="#_ftn13" data-href="#_ftn13" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[13]</a>. The density of the fuel produces means that little waste is produced. All the nuclear waste produced in the United States since 1950 could fit on one football field stacked ten yards high <a href="#_ftn14" data-href="#_ftn14" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[14]</a>. The small amount of waste produced could be reduced further by recycling. Used fuel is currently not recycled in the U.S. However, some countries like France reuse their fuel to generate even more power <a href="#_ftn15" data-href="#_ftn15" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[15]</a>.</p><figure name="d5d6" id="d5d6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*5D-lnUyGrpkMfjQ4" data-width="6024" data-height="4024" data-unsplash-photo-id="vMQFh9rAkeU" alt="Nuclear power plant" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5D-lnUyGrpkMfjQ4"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@llehotsky?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@llehotsky?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Lukáš Lehotský</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="a9c9" id="a9c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The startup costs for a nuclear reactor are high and following all regulations to ensure safety is difficult. However, once setup a nuclear reactor has the highest capacity of any power source and some of the lowest variable costs<a href="#_ftn16" data-href="#_ftn16" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[16]</a>. These factors make nuclear a compelling option for baseline power generation. Supplying electricity relies on having some base amount of power always being available. Currently, across the U.S, this role is filled by a combination of coal, gas, and nuclear. Nuclear is the only sustainable source among the three and the other energy sources examined are too variable to fulfill the baseline role. Nuclear simply must have some role to play otherwise the grid will be like a house with no foundation, unstable and prone to disaster.</p><p name="6ad2" id="6ad2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The philanthropic billionaire Bill Gates has recognized the importance of nuclear and made it a central plank in his war on climate change. He wrote in his novel <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,</em> “[Nuclear] is the only carbon-free energy source that can reliably deliver power day and night, through every season, almost anywhere on earth, that has been proven to work on a large scale”<a href="#_ftn17" data-href="#_ftn17" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[17]</a>. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power certainly have their place in a more sustainable grid, but they cannot generate power as consistently as nuclear. Gates, convinced of the need for nuclear based on the science, has staked a fortune developing a new class of nuclear power with the company TerraPower. The company has been researching using nuclear waste as fuel and is working with the U.S. government to break ground on new facilities.</p><p name="9b1b" id="9b1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima illustrate possible dangers of nuclear power and heavily contribute to negative public opinion. These terrible events have turned into great learning moments for engineers and scientists who have come up with better designs in the years since. New nuclear power plants, like the ones from TerraPower, use modern designs and have been extensively modeled to ensure feasibility and safety <a href="#_ftn18" data-href="#_ftn18" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[18]</a>. The work being done by Bill Gates and TerraPower could play a key role in transitioning to a sustainable work. The research has been done, now the time for the investments in these new nuclear projects has come.</p><p name="04f1" id="04f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An often-discussed futuristic energy source is fusion power. Fusion power takes light atoms and combines them to form heavier atoms. The parts of the atoms remain the same, so mass is conserved, but the process releases a tremendous amount of energy. The Sun and stars burn bright because of fusion power. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion produces no dangerous waste byproducts. This technology promises truly safe, clean, renewable, long-lasting, and limitless energy. Unfortunately, the technology is notoriously difficult to develop. Atoms are like siblings who do not like each other and refuse to be in the same room. Combining two atoms requires tremendous heat and pressure. For decades scientists have been quoted as saying fusion is just around the corner <a href="#_ftn19" data-href="#_ftn19" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[19]</a>. Despite the long history of unfilled promises, progress is being made. An increasing number of projects are leaving laboratories and entering the field of entrepreneurial startups <a href="#_ftn20" data-href="#_ftn20" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[20]</a>. In the future this promising source of power may bring incredible, unforeseen possibilities and catapult humanity forward. In the meantime, laboratory results and early-stage startups are unable to affect grid sustainability. Therefore, fusion power must be left to the science fiction authors for now.</p><p name="4c49" id="4c49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Solar, wind, hydroelectricity, and nuclear are all sustainable sources and have a place in the grid of tomorrow. Nuclear power is a great option to replace the current fossil fuel baseline power. Solar and wind are key areas of investment as variable electricity generators to top off nuclear power. Those three sources have reached the point of technological feasibility to be used now. Going forward new sources like wave power and fusion could find their place in a sustainable grid.</p><p name="2650" id="2650" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, let the attention be turned toward energy storage solutions. As displayed by the recent California and Texas blackouts, the failure of the grid causes a collapse of the modern features of life. Evidently, it is unacceptable for the grid to ever be down. Designing systems that are fault tolerant with one-hundred percent uptime is a tall task, but engineers have stepped up to the plate with many possible solutions. While there are many ways of designing fault tolerant grids, the most important feature is energy storage.</p><figure name="202e" id="202e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*95gg8JiZos8kwM6X" data-width="5184" data-height="3888" data-unsplash-photo-id="NIDPm-ltVbA" alt="Batteries store power and can be used for the grid" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*95gg8JiZos8kwM6X"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Brett Jordan</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="0b55" id="0b55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The first storage solution to consider is one that everyone is intimately familiar with. The battery powers everything from laptops, smartphones, and flashlights to electric vehicles. The same principle can be applied to the electrical grid. For example, people charge their phones when they do not need them. The batteries inside store the energy and then release it when the phone is being used on the go. Supersized grid batteries can be used to absorb excess power when supply is higher than demand like on sunny and windy days. Then when power demands rise the stored energy is released into the system to compensate for variabilities. Batteries have a lifespan and need to be carefully handled at the end of their lifetime due to materials they are made out of. Fortunately, batteries can be recycled and broken back down into components <a href="#_ftn21" data-href="#_ftn21" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[21]</a>. Recycling batteries will ensure the sustainability of using batteries in the electric grid.</p><p name="2edc" id="2edc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After batteries the next energy storage possibility is pumped and dammed water. The technique here is simple, but not immediately apparent. Water wants to follow gravity and flow to the lowest point. To store energy in water, it can be pumped to a high location. When energy is needed a dam can let the water flow to a lower position. The flowing water spins a turbine and generates electricity the same way classic dams like the Hoover dam do. The more water stored and the higher that water is stored the more potential energy present. A key benefit of this technology is its lifespan. Unlike batteries which eventually need to be replaced and recycled, the topography needed for pumped water lasts for thousands of years. Researchers have even developed computer algorithms capable of searching for the best locations <a href="#_ftn22" data-href="#_ftn22" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[22]</a>. Advances like these make this simple and old technology ready for the future and easier to implement.</p><p name="4c01" id="4c01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, there are more unconventional methods for storing electricity. These unconventional energy storage technologies include flywheels, hydrogen, and thermal storage. A flywheel is a heavy object that is rapidly spinning. The spinning of the object stores the power. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that can be created from excess power and stored long term. The only byproduct from burning hydrogen is water. Finally, thermal storage is when materials are superheated, and the stored heat is then used for power when needed. These methods may be unconventional at the current moment in time, but all technologies at are unconventional when they are new.</p><p name="dab2" id="dab2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Engineers need every possible tool available to them if the best possible outcome is to be achieved. These technologies exist and are ready for use, they only need the proper investments to be built. Similar to energy production, all these energy storage solutions could be incredibly helpful. At the current moment these solutions have not be put into practice because of underinvestment. Proper investments in energy storage are needed for a sustainable grid.</p><p name="8cd0" id="8cd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The electrification of America began with the invention of the lightbulb by Thomas Edison in 1879 <a href="#_ftn23" data-href="#_ftn23" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[23]</a>. In the over one-hundred years since the electrical grid has maintained roughly the same configuration. In addition to changing the sources that power the grid and storage, making the grid smarter can be an effective way of designing a sustainable electrical grid. One key technology to invest in and roll out as part of a future grid is distributed grids. This technology brings the digital advances of the twenty-first century to a utilities industry stuck in a previous era.</p><figure name="18b4" id="18b4" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*luT2hc6mQdDsRf4z" data-width="3850" data-height="5133" data-unsplash-photo-id="KsSUgqDwvb0" alt="The light bulb was one of the first uses of electricity" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*luT2hc6mQdDsRf4z"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johannes25?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@johannes25?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Johan Extra</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="f45c" id="f45c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A distributed grid is a two-sided coin: distributed energy production and distributed energy storage. An example of distributed energy production would be solar panels on roofs of homes, offices, and factories. An example of distributed energy storage would be battery packs attached to each home and building. The grid could be run by smart technology that dynamically takes energy from places where it had been stored to other areas where there are deficits. The more widespread the distributed grid is the more efficient it can be because it can spread demand across a wide area.</p><p name="4b3f" id="4b3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another distributed grid feature comes from electric cars. As electric vehicles become more widespread, more people will have access to a large battery in their homes. The majority of time cars are spent idly sitting <a href="#_ftn24" data-href="#_ftn24" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[24]</a>. These idle batteries could be used as a way augment energy storage. For example, perhaps it is an unusually cloudy day so less solar energy is generated. The smart grid knows from your car’s charging schedule that is unlikely to be used for the remainder of the day, so the grid starts pulling energy from your car’s battery to meet grid demand. As demand matches supply the grid starts to refill your car’s battery. For the use of your battery the grid operator could offer financial compensation.</p><p name="9b5b" id="9b5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All these incredible energy production techniques can offer tremendous improvements, but they offer no such benefits left in the laboratory. An investment of resources, both time and money, is needed to bring these production methods to fruition. Utilities in the United States are a highly regulated industry. Private companies make some decisions, but they make them in concert with economic concerns, regulators, administration wishes, and government financing. This makes any changes to the grid infrastructure an inherently political debate.</p><p name="f432" id="f432" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As of the writing of this essay, President Biden’s administration recently unveiled a large infrastructure package that included considerable funding for many of the technologies and solutions outlined. Notably the package called for $100 billion in funding for the electric grid and clean energy <a href="#_ftn25" data-href="#_ftn25" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[25]</a>.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em></strong>The European Union has laid out massive plans consisting of funding, loans, and regulatory incentives <a href="#_ftn26" data-href="#_ftn26" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[26]</a>. These kinds of big, bold actions are key and match the size of the problem. These are investments in the future, but they are also investments for the current moment. Solar, wind, nuclear, batteries, smarter grids, and many of the technologies discussed throughout this paper are ready today. Thanks to dedicated researchers and entrepreneurs the technologies only get better with use. Making the investments in ready technologies will lead to a more sustainable grid. Additionally, these investments will have positive externalities like creating new jobs, cleaning up the air, and leaving people healthier.</p><figure name="e4d5" id="e4d5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*86ZIbPQZ1JSEWjCN" data-width="4153" data-height="2769" data-unsplash-photo-id="3NR9Brj62cQ" alt="Plains" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*86ZIbPQZ1JSEWjCN"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mjpringles?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@mjpringles?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Mike Prince</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p name="60a1" id="60a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The ethical dilemma lies with taking no action. One hundred eleven people perished as a result of the 2021 Texas grid failure <a href="#_ftn27" data-href="#_ftn27" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[27]</a>.These tragic deaths could have been avoided if the grid was properly prepared. In addition to death, power failures cause economic and psychological damage. Marginalized individuals, like the elderly, low income, and disabled have the least resources to adapt to power failures and have the highest probability of being negatively affected. Without changes to the grid these problems will continue to get worse. Part of the ethos of America is leaving the next generation something better. Failing to update the grid will be a failure to the next generation.</p><p name="a56d" id="a56d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Redesigning the electrical grid will bring about creative destruction creating winners and losers. For example, jobs in fossil fuel industries like coal mining will be eliminated. Coal communities have labored for decades to supply America with power. The changing grid should not punish those hardworking communities, so the need to change the grid should be balanced with equity. Not protecting the equality of the transition risks the entire process because job losses could swing public opinion against the necessary changes. One way to protect these communities is through creating new jobs. A perfect opportunity to create new jobs exists with the massive monetary investment necessary to build out sustainable technologies. New jobs like solar panels installers, wind turbine maintainers, and renewable energy engineers could replace old jobs like oil drillers, coal miners, and petroleum engineers. Ensuring an equitable transition is key to maintaining public support and charting the best ethical course of action.</p><p name="c9a3" id="c9a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To conclude, the current energy grid is insufficient to fulfill American needs going forward in the face of climate change. The grid of tomorrow needs to be safer, cleaner, and more reliable. Investments in a combination of new energy production methods and energy storage solutions can propel the American grid down that path. Future technologies will certainly help, but the process needs to begin now. The set of solutions available at the current moment provide ample opportunity to improve on the existing grid infrastructure. If done properly, future generations will look back with gratitude. If done poorly or not undertaken at all then current solutions will no longer perform and people in the future will be left worse off.</p><p name="505c" id="505c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="#_ftnref1" data-href="#_ftnref1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[1]</a> “Electricity explained: Electricity generation, capacity, and sales in the United States,” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">U.S. Energy Information Administration, </em>March 18, 2021, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php." data-href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php." class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php.</a></p><p name="a740" id="a740" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="#_ftnref2" data-href="#_ftnref2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[2]</a> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">U.S. Energy Information Administration, </em>“Electricity explained: Electricity generation, capacity, and sales in the United States.”</p><p name="3206" id="3206" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="#_ftnref3" data-href="#_ftnref3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[3]</a> Renewable Energy vs Sustainable Energy: What’s the Difference?” <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies</em>, December 7, 2020, <a href="https://energy.sais.jhu.edu/articles/renewable-energy-vs-sustainable-energy/." data-href="https://energy.sais.jhu.edu/articles/renewable-energy-vs-sustainable-energy/." class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://energy.sais.jhu.edu/articles/renewable-energy-vs-sustainable-energy/.</a></p><p name="5b7c" id="5b7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="#_ftnref4" data-href="#_ftnref4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">[4]</a> David L.
