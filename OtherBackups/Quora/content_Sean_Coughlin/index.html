Increases in processing power used to be a given, but now engineers and researchers are looking for other more creative ways to accomplish their goals. For example most high end deep learning is run off of GPUs which were originally designed for the video game industry and only stumbled upon for other purposes. The absence of Moore&#8217;s Law doesn't mean the end of computing progress instead other innovations will be sought after and found.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=1c0098&amp;url=http://www.wired.co.uk/article/moores-law-ending-good-ai" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="wired.co.uk">Why the death of Moore's Law could give birth to more human-like machines</a></span></p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Mar 27, 2017 06:55 PM PDT</span></div><div><strong>Content language: </strong><span>English</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">How water resistant is the Apple Watch Series 1?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Apple calls it &#8220;splash-resistant&#8221; so it'll take some water, but I wouldn't go swimming with it.</p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Mar 27, 2017 06:57 PM PDT</span></div><div><strong>Content language: </strong><span>English</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">How did Tim Cook's degree in industrial engineering help him become the CEO of Apple?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Tim Cook is considered a complete master of product chain development and he played a crucial role in developing Apple&#8217;s production systems and the logistics behind it all.

The paradox has no easy answer and has been debated for almost 2000 years. A question like this is more about the thought experiment and less about one specific answer. There are many questions like this that don't really seek one answer or are even perhaps unanswerable.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"><span class="qlink_container"><a href="https://www.quora.com/_/redirect?sig=0b932d&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org">Ship of Theseus - Wikipedia</a></span></p></span></div><div><strong>Creation time: </strong><span>Jul 03, 2017 05:21 PM PDT</span></div><div><strong>Content language: </strong><span>English</span></div></p><hr /><p><h2>Answer</h2><div><strong>Question: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext">Apple iPhone turns 10 years old, what has it meant to you?</span></div><div><strong>Content: </strong><span class="rendered_qtext"><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I'm not that old so a majority of my life has been in the iPhone era and it has totally shaped my entire life.

The sport has a tendency to select the people with the best body types and elevate them to more elite levels which makes it seem like the sport mints tall people.

The benefits of weight lifting for swimming come once your technique has progressed to a fairly advanced level. I swam for almost 6 years before I ever stepped in a weight room for swim practice and that's a good thing. Weight lifting has tons of benefits, but when specifically applied to swimming it's going to make you tighter (as you build muscle you generally get less flexible), increase your risk of injury, and it makes you more tired in the water so you can't focus on technique.</p><p class="qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Once you have progressed beyond the level of beginner then swimming is going to be a big help in continuing your training. You asked specifically about flexibility and generally as you put on muscle, especially a lot of muscle, you lose flexibility.

A lot of apps work really well, especially the native Apple apps, but because of the space screen real estate developers are really forced to get creative with their UI. Despite their best efforts, no developer is going to be able to squeeze their entire app into that little watch.
