Based in the vibrant city of Chicago, I am a software engineer by day with a knack for hobbies by night. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, weight lifting, hiking running, reading whatever I can get my hands on, traveling, gardening, and cooking. I wish I had more free time or more hours in the day, but don't we all.

This is my vanity project blog. Let's see how it goes!
