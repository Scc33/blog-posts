> Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre: *dragon riders*.
> 
> But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.
> 
> She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.
> 
> Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out: *graduate or die.*

Wow. [*Fourth Wing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Wing) got my attention. A kingdom at war, dragons, griffins, and magic, it has every element of fantasy my inner geek could hope for.

To make comparisons to other novels, I'd say this is a cross between [*Ender's Game*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game), [*Eragon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eragon), and one of those steamy novels you find in airport bookstores.

Young adults interested in defending the kingdom go to a highly deadly Dragon college that distinctly reminded me of the brutal Battle School from *Ender's Game*. Those who survive training pair with a dragon with a mental bond that lasts for life, similar to *Eragon*. Finally, the author takes the opportunity to develop sexual tension in a distinctly not PG manner. I thought it was tastefully done, and I felt the tension furthered character development.

At the time of this review, the book currently has a 4.65 / 5 with 550 thousand reviews on Goodreads. That is easily one of the highest scores I have ever seen. My usual Goodreads review metrics are:

* &lt; 4.0 - not good unless it is a classic
    
* \&gt; 4.1 - usually a good read but not guaranteed
    
* \&gt; 4.2 - okay this book will be really fun
    
* \&gt; 4.3 - you will tell your friends about these books
    
* \&gt; 4.4 - gripping and you will want to read in a day
    
* \&gt; 4.5 - incredible and making your top books of all time
    

All this is to say, you don't need to take my word for it! At well over a 4.6, this book breaks any Goodreads logic. Go enjoy this book!
