## What is software testing?

I started my career with an internship in software quality assurance. Throughout that internship, I learned about the alphabet soup of software testing: TDD, BDD, ATDD, UAT, PT, etc. All of those letters are easy to set your head spinning.

As my career has progressed I've migrated from quality assurance to software development. I've only seen the importance of good testing practices grow and I use testing tools and frameworks on a daily basis.

In this series, I will break down the various ways of testing code in short digestible chunks. I'll provide some background and pros and cons of each method.
