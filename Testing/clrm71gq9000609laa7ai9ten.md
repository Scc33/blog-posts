## Introduction

Ensuring optimal performance and quality is paramount for web development. This is where automated testing tools like Playwright and Google's Lighthouse come into play.

For software engineers, integrating these tools can assist the testing process, paving the way for more robust, user-friendly web applications.

### Understanding Playwright

Playwright is a cutting-edge, open-source framework developed by Microsoft. It's designed to enable end-to-end testing for web applications across all major browsers including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Its standout features include cross-browser support, native mobile emulation, and the ability to simulate various network conditions. This makes Playwright an invaluable tool for developers aiming to create versatile, cross-platform web applications.

For more information, visit [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).

### Exploring Lighthouse

Google's Lighthouse is an automated tool designed for web page quality assessments. It provides audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web applications, and more, offering scores across these domains along with actionable recommendations for improvement.

Lighthouse is instrumental in identifying areas for enhancement in web applications, ensuring they meet the highest standards of quality.

### The Importance of Combined Testing

Integrating Playwright with Lighthouse brings a holistic approach to testing. While Playwright ensures functional correctness, Lighthouse assesses quality metrics. This combination is crucial for early bug detection, maintaining high performance standards, and ensuring an optimal user experience.

[Playwright-lighthouse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-lighthouse) is a great package for combing these two types of testing and let's dive into using it with a hands on tutorial.

## Hands On with Playwright and Playwright-lighthouse

### Setting Up Your Environment

To begin, you'll need to set up both `playwright` and `playwright-lighthouse` in your project. First, install Playwright using npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright
```

Then, add `playwright-lighthouse`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright-lighthouse
```

These installations equip your project with the necessary tools to conduct both Playwright and Lighthouse audits.

### Implementing Playwright-Lighthouse Tests

Letâ€™s dive into how you can use these tools together. Consider the following code example:

```javascript
import { playAudit } from "playwright-lighthouse";
import { test, chromium } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("audit", () => {
  test("run lighthouse", async () => {
    const browser = await chromium.launch({
      args: ["--remote-debugging-port=9222"],
      headless: true
    });
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto("http://localhost:4173/");

    await playAudit({
      page: page,
      thresholds: {
        performance: 50,
        accessibility: 100,
        "best-practices": 100,
        seo: 100
      },
      port: 9222
    });

    await browser.close();
  });
});
```

In this script:

1. **Browser Initialization**: We launch Chromium using Playwright, specifying remote debugging and headless mode.
    
2. **Page Navigation**: The script navigates to the specified URL.
    
3. **Lighthouse Audit**: The `playAudit` function runs the Lighthouse audit against the page, with specified performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO thresholds.
    

In addition to the test code, you can add an execution script to your package.json and configure Playwright with a [config](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration) (`playwright.config.js`).

```json
{
    "test:lighthouse": "npx playwright test --project lighthouse"
}
```

### CI/CD Integration

Integrating this setup into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the testing process. Each deployment undergoes rigorous quality checks, ensuring consistent performance and adherence to web standards.

For example, I have incorporated lighthouse testing into the [CI pipeline for my personal site](https://github.com/Scc33/Scc33.github.io/blob/3e0e1745c1b618819c856df4f7ab5943c3d7421b/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L79). A lighthouse test execution will occur on every PR and merge to master. This provides immediate feedback on performance and accessibility that a user will experience.

```yaml
  analyze:
    # Runs on successful playwright
    needs: [build, test]
    name: lighthouse-test
    # Running on ubuntu-latest, nothing special
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # As usual, we simply checkout the project
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Install the latest version of node
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
      # Install Yarn (prefered build tool)
      - name: Install Yarn
        run: npm install -g yarn
      # Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      # Install Playwright browsers
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      # Run Lighthouse Playwright tests
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: yarn run test:lighthouse
```

## Conclusion

Integrating Playwright with Lighthouse offers a comprehensive approach to web application testing. This powerful combination can significantly enhance the quality and performance of your projects, streamline your workflow, and ensure a superior user experience.
