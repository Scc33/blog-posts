Welcome to this installment of our software engineering interview tutorial series. Today, we're diving into a common yet intriguing problem often encountered on platforms like LeetCode: calculating the maximum depth of a binary tree ([LeetCode 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)).

This challenge is not just about finding a solution; it's about understanding the intricacies of binary trees, recursion, and the implications of our approach on performance. Whether you're gearing up for interviews or honing your problem-solving skills, this guide will arm you with the knowledge and tools you need to excel.

## Understanding the Problem

At its core, the problem asks us to determine the maximum depth (or height) of a binary tree, which is the number of nodes from the root down to the farthest leaf. Consider a tree with a single root node and two children; its depth is 2. But, if one child has its own child, the tree's depth becomes 3.

**Examples:**

* For a tree structure `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`, the maximum depth is 3.
    
* A tree like `[1,null,2]` has a depth of 2, illustrating a lean, imbalanced tree but still showcasing the need to accurately assess depth.
    

> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *its maximum depth*.
> 
> A binary tree's **maximum depth**Â is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Strategy for Solution

To solve this problem, we employ recursion, a fundamental concept in computer science where a function calls itself with a subset of the original problem. The beauty of recursion in this context lies in its ability to elegantly traverse the tree, depth-first, ensuring we reach every leaf and calculate the depth along the way.

The process is straightforward:

* If the current node (root) is `None`, the depth is 0 since we've hit the base case of an empty tree.
    
* Otherwise, we recursively calculate the depth of the left and right subtrees and take the maximum of both, adding 1 to account for the current node's depth.
    

### Big O Analysis

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we must visit each node exactly once to determine the depth. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

## Solution in Python

Let's look at the Python solution, noting how recursion plays a pivotal role:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def maxDepth(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        # Recursively find the depth of left and right subtrees, and take the max
        return max(1 + maxDepth(root.left), 1 + maxDepth(root.right))
```

## Solution in TypeScript

Translating our approach to TypeScript, we maintain the same logic while adapting to the syntax and type definitions of TypeScript:

```typescript
function maxDepth(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (root === null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return Math.max(1 + maxDepth(root.left), 1 + maxDepth(root.right));
}
```

## Solution in Java

Lastly, our Java solution also mirrors the recursive strategy, showcasing the universal applicability of our approach:

```java
public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return Math.max(1 + maxDepth(root.left), 1 + maxDepth(root.right));
}
```
