Welcome to my very first blog post! I was inspired to create a blog by a [freeCodeCamp New Year's Resolution Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/2022-become-a-dev-new-years-resolution-challenge/). freeCodeCamp challenged new developers to take to the internet and blog what they learn while on their programming journey. As a recent college graduate with a degree in Computer Science, I felt inspired to share what I learn as I take my first steps into the professional programming world.
