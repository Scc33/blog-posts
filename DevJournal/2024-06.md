#### React State

*URL: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1799435036736778364.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

In React, state can be managed using several methods: local state within a component using `useState` or class-based `setState`, context state for global state management across the component tree using `useContext` and `Context API`, and third-party state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or Recoil for more complex and scalable state management solutions. Local state is ideal for managing state within a single component, while context state is useful for sharing state across multiple components without prop drilling. Third-party libraries offer advanced features like middleware, actions, and reducers, making them suitable for larger applications with intricate state management needs.

#### Engineering Metrics

*URL: https://hybridhacker.email/p/how-to-use-engineering-metrics?r=2bjtip&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=tldrwebdev&triedRedirect=true*

Delivery metrics are key performance indicators that measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the software delivery process. They include:

1. **Lead Time for Changes**: The time taken from the first commit of a feature to its deployment in production, indicating the speed of the development process.
2. **Release Frequency**: How often the organization deploys code, reflecting the agility of the release process.
3. **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**: The average time required to recover from a failure, showcasing the team's responsiveness and resilience.
4. **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production, highlighting the stability and quality of the releases.

These metrics, popularized by the DORA framework, help organizations measure and improve their software delivery performance.

#### 12 Factor app

*URL: https://12factor.net*

12-factor app is a methodology for building SaaS. Should be declarative for setup (think Terraform). 
Should have a clean contract with OS (think containers or VM). 
Should be suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms.
Should minimize divergence between dev and prod to enable CD.
Can support scaling up without changes to tooling, architecture, or dev practices.
Notice that the programming language and services don't matter for these goals.
This paradigm can from the developers of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

##### Factor 1: Codebase

If there are multiple codebases than it's not an app but a distributed system. 
Each component in distributed system is an app and each can comply with twelve-factor.
One codebase per app. But there will be many deploys of an app.
A deploy is a running isntance of an app (typically a production or staging site).

##### Factor 2: Dependencies

Dependencies should be explicity declared and isolated.
- Think like lock files.

##### Factor 3: Config

Configs should be stored in the enviornment.
Configs are everything that is likely to vary between deploys (dev, staging, prod).
Config should be strictly separated from code.
Examples of configs: resource handles to the database, credentials to external services, per deploy values such as version number.

##### Factor 4: Backing services

Treat backing services as attached resources.
A backing service is any service consumed over the network
- Databases (MySQL or MariaDB)
- Messaging/queueing systems (RabbitMQ or Kafka)
- SMTP for example
- Caching such as Redis

##### Factor 5: Build, release, run

Build, release, run...
Strictly separate build and run stages.
- Build converts code into executable bundle known as a build
- Release takes build and combines with configs
Releases always have a unqiue release ID that cannot be mutated once created.
Any change should be a new release.

##### Factor 6: Processes

The app should be executed as one or more stateless processes. 
Apps should be stateless and share nothing. 
Any data that needs to persist should be stored in a stateful backing service (typically a database).
Sticky sesions are typically a bad idea and something like Memcached or Redis that offers time-expiration is more robust.

##### Factor 7: Port binding

Web apps are sometimes executed inside a webserver container (for example Java apps running inside Tomcat).
Web apps can export HTTp as a service by binding to a port.
You can inject the webserver library using dependency declaration (factor 2).

##### Factor 8: Concurrency

Scale out via the process model.
Processes should be first class citizens.
Individual applications can only grow so large (vertical scale) so at some point you will have to scale out.

##### Factor 9: Disposability

Processes should be disposable meaning they can stop or start at a moments notice.
This helps enable scaling up and scaling down (elasticity and scalability).
Try to minimize startup time.

##### Factor 10: Dev/prod parity

Keep dev, staging and prod as similar as possible.
Gaps manifest because of time gap, personnel gap (devs writing and ops deployingg), tools gap (different local vs prod stack).
Continuous deployment is better for keeping gap between dev and prod small.
Resist the urge to use different services between dev and prod.
Lightweight backing services like SQLite locally and PostgreSQL in prod is common but usually bad practice.

##### Factor 11: Logs

Logs should be treated as event streams.
Logs are the stream of aggregated, time-ordered events.
Each running process should write its event stream unbuffed to stdout.
Helpful for finding specific events, large-scale graphic of trends, active alerting.

##### Factor 12: Admin proccesses

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.

##### My thoughts

The 12 factor app is a nice starting paradigm. To me it seems a little outdated (I think it was written in 2011). For example, kubernetes handles small things like port bindings. Regardless, this seems like a good starting point for applications.

#### Python notebooks are bad

*URL: https://yobibyte.github.io/notebooks.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

Notebooks, while convenient, encourage bad practices, lack proper versioning and state management, and can lead to inefficiencies and distractions, ultimately hindering both individual productivity and team collaboration.

#### Programming and thinking

*URL: https://agileotter.blogspot.com/2014/09/programming-is-mostly-thinking.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

Because software production involves only electrons, its marginal cost is essentially zero, shifting the importance entirely to design. With an infinitely productive software factory, the primary focus would be on creating high-quality, well-thought-out designs rather than the physical act of coding itself.

#### What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

*URL: https://vercel.com/blog/demystifying-inp-new-tools-and-actionable-insights*

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a metric that became part of Google’s Core Web Vitals in March 2024, measuring the time from a user interaction to the next paint of the web page. It emphasizes providing feedback to the user within 200ms to acknowledge their input, rather than completing all rendering tasks within this timeframe. Optimizing INP involves minimizing delays caused by third-party JavaScript, shortening event handler phases through techniques like React's memoization, and helping the browser render efficiently using tools like CSS containment. Real-world strategies, such as those used on Vercel's websites, include splitting the user interaction response into acknowledgment and action phases, ensuring immediate feedback without compromising performance.

#### Decoupling to improve pushing at GitHub

*URL: https://github.blog/2024-06-11-how-we-improved-push-processing-on-github/?utm_source=blog.quastor.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-github-rebuilt-their-push-processing-system*

GitHub improved its push processing by decoupling a massive background job into multiple isolated, parallel jobs using Kafka events, resulting in lower latency, better observability, and more reliable processing. This new system reduces the blast radius of errors, allows better ownership of push tasks, and processes pushes more efficiently, handling nearly all push events without failures.

#### Sleep deprivation disrupts memory

*URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01732-y?utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

Sleep deprivation disrupts sharp-wave ripple activity in the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory formation, leading to weakened and less organized neural patterns even after subsequent normal sleep. This suggests a critical window for memory processing that, once missed, cannot be fully recovered, emphasizing the importance of continuous, quality sleep for effective memory consolidation. These findings could eventually inform treatments for memory-related conditions, potentially aiding in the management of traumatic memories in disorders like PTSD.

#### GenAI and more software engineers

*URL: https://roarepally.com/blog/ai-and-software-engineers?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

The article predicts that the demand for software engineers will increase over the next 20 years, driven by generative AI tools that enhance, rather than replace, traditional software engineering roles. This trend will make software engineering more accessible, creating more opportunities for innovation and increasing the need for top talent, while evolving the skill sets required in the field.

#### SaaS architecture (tons of automation)

*URL: https://anthonynsimon.com/blog/one-man-saas-architecture/?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

The article details the architecture and tools used by a one-person tech startup to run a SaaS application, highlighting the use of Kubernetes on AWS for managing infrastructure. The author emphasizes the importance of automation, reliability, and scalability, achieved through tools like Terraform, Flux, and Prometheus for version-controlled infrastructure, automated deployments, and monitoring. The setup includes managed services like Postgres and ClickHouse for data storage, Redis for caching, and Celery for scheduled tasks, all orchestrated within a Kubernetes cluster. The author stresses the benefits of a highly automated and resilient infrastructure, allowing minimal time spent on management and more on development. The article serves as a practical guide for software engineers interested in leveraging modern DevOps practices to efficiently manage and scale their own projects.

#### Back to On-prem

*URL: https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0*

Basecamp is leaving the cloud because they find it cost-ineffective and unnecessarily complex for their stable, medium-sized operations, preferring to manage their own servers for better control and lower costs. 
> "The cloud excels at two ends of the spectrum, where only one end was ever relevant for us. The first end is when your application is so simple and low traffic that you really do save on complexity by starting with fully managed services. This is the shining path that Heroku forged, and the one that has since been paved by Render and others. It remains a fabulous way to get started when you have no customers, and it'll carry you quite far even once you start having some."
> "The second is when your load is highly irregular. When you have wild swings or towering peaks in usage. When the baseline is a sliver of your largest needs. Or when you have no idea whether you need ten servers or a hundred."
> "Now the argument always goes: Sure, but you have to manage these machines! The cloud is so much simpler! The savings will all be there in labor costs! Except no. Anyone who thinks running a major service like HEY or Basecamp in the cloud is "simple" has clearly never tried. Some things are simpler, others more complex, but on the whole, I've yet to hear of organizations at our scale being able to materially shrink their operations team, just because they moved to the cloud."

#### Benefits of on-prem

*URL: https://zwischenzugs.com/2024/06/18/ok-cloud-on-prem-is-alright/?utm_source=tldrdevops*

TLDR; cloud is really expensive and sometimes running own servers is cheaper

In recent years, businesses have shifted from a wholesale cloud migration strategy to a more hybrid approach, keeping some workloads on-premises and moving others to the cloud only when necessary. This change is driven by factors such as migration fatigue, hardware costs, and macroeconomic trends, leading to a slowdown in cloud adoption growth. As cloud spend continues to rise, albeit more slowly, the emphasis is on ensuring software workloads are portable and can run efficiently across different environments, whether in the cloud or on-premises.

#### Finance department and IT

*URL: https://blog.container-solutions.com/to-transform-it-start-with-finance*

Finance often gets in the way of software development because finance sets budgets and engineers have to work with the budget constraint first and foremost.

> "Yearly accounting cycles make a mockery of technical teams’ attempts to be truly ‘Agile’ in response to business demand. If a released MVP product flies off the shelf in February, then you can’t get funding to scale it up until January next year."

Basically [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) or that communication between teams is reflected to the product.

#### Budgetting and Agile development

*URL: https://blog.container-solutions.com/money-flows-part-iii-youre-only-as-agile-as-your-budget*

> "you’re only as Agile as your budget"

SpaceX's product management approach prioritizes rapid innovation and agility by emphasizing real-time budgeting, decentralized decision-making, and alignment of organizational structure to product needs, rather than adhering to traditional project management norms like fixed budgets and deadlines. This methodology allows SpaceX to innovate quickly and efficiently, demonstrating that financial agility is crucial for achieving organizational agility and maintaining a competitive edge.

#### 10x vs 1x work

*URL: https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/10x-work-versus-1x-work?utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

The essay argues against the rigid routines and "hustle culture" often promoted for achieving success, instead advocating for embracing serendipity and high-impact work, termed "10x work." It suggests that significant career achievements come from pivotal, unpredictable moments rather than from perfecting daily habits. The author emphasizes the importance of creating environments where such high-impact opportunities can emerge, focusing on agency, risk, and new information. As Scott Adams writes, "Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable," advocating for becoming exceptional in a unique combination of skills.

### Things I should learn more about

- It would be good to have a better idea of how infrastructure works. Terraform and AWS would be a good starting point.

#### HTTPS Guide

*URL: https://devonperoutky.super.site/blog-posts/mediocre-engineers-guide-to-https*

Sven layer model: Physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, application

##### Lifecycle of an HTTP request

- Process starts at application layer where client constructs HTTP request (text-based so plain text is sent over wire). Contains HTTP method, request resource, protocol version, and everything is in `key: value` format.
- DNS translates doman to IP address (via stub, recursive, and authoratative resolvers)
- TCP handshake (TCP is connection based and UDP is connectionalless that doesn't guarantee delivery, order, or errorchecking). TCP has SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.
- With TCP connection in place HTTP can be sent along the connection.
- This then goes even lower level (think BGP from Cloud Networking UIUC CS 435).
- Server receives HTTP requests and responds with similar header body format with status information (code like 200/400) included.
- HTTP is not secure at all because it is plaintext

##### Adding security

**HTTPS = HTTP + Encryption**

- Security layer (TLS - transport layer security, SSL - secure sockets layer)
- TLS has a handshake process to determine how client and server will exchange - encryption and verification keys
- During the handshake an algorithm must be aggreed on for verify, compressing, and encrypting messages.
- TLS versions change the process for handshaking

#### Complexity in programming (falsehoods about names)

*URL: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/*

Okay this one is just funny. It's all about all the things you can't assume about peoples names.

> People’s names are assigned at birth.
> OK, maybe not at birth, but at least pretty close to birth.
> Alright, alright, within a year or so of birth.
> Five years?
> You’re kidding me, right?

### What I am working on

- Today I had to resolve security issues coming from container source images. Remember in the future that a container has some base image and the application code running on it. Your vulnerabilites can come either from the image or the application.
- I also had to resolve an issue with overusing contracted SaaS resources. Remember to evaluate the contract requirements when it comes to using applications.

#### History of CI tests

*URL: https://graphite.dev/blog/invention-of-modern-ci?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

This evolution of continuous integration testing is important because it has drastically reduced the time and resources required to ensure code quality, enabling faster, more reliable software development and deployment.

> [Days & weeks] In the 1980s, software code changes were slowly reviewed by hand to find bugs. Test suites might be run overnight or only before releases.
> [Days and nights] In the 90s, automated tests became more commonly written, whether by specialized software testers or eventually by the code authors themselves. Code changes are started to get tested before rather than after merging with the rest of the codebase.
> [Hours and minutes] In the early 2000s, the first automatic integration testing servers launched and became popular, leading to the testing of every change as it merged into the codebase.
> [Minutes] Around 2011, zero-maintenance CI test services became available. Now, small teams could also benefit from testing every change.

#### High coverage and bugs

*URL: https://blog.codepipes.com/testing/code-coverage.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

> Q. Look, this is great, but I still need to find the perfect code coverage for my new project. If it is not 100%, what should I aim for?
> A. Without more context on your project all I can say is that the minimum code coverage is 20%. This number is based on the Pareto Principle and assumes that 20% of your code is responsible for 80% of your bugs. See also my point about “critical code” in my testing guide.

I like this reminder. Orgs like to emphasize high coverage percentage but high impact testing should be prioritized. If you have a high change velocity and a high change success rate, why does code coverage matter?

#### Platform engineering myths

*URL: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/another-five-myths-about-platform-engineering/?utm_source=tldrdevops*

- **Platform engineering doesn't eliminate infrastructure teams**: Infrastructure specialists are still needed for maintenance and troubleshooting.
- **Impact on staffing costs**: Uses existing DevOps staff, requiring initial upskilling, ultimately increasing efficiency and reducing operational overhead.
- **Solving problems quickly**: Change takes time; start with an MVP and iterate based on feedback.
- **Applying platform engineering**: Focus on high-load, high-friction applications first, and build confidence with smaller services.
- **Cloud services and platform engineering**: Integrates cloud services into a cohesive developer experience.
- **Key takeaways**: Builds on DevOps for scalable IT and software management; tailor the approach to your organization, start small, and iterate for best results.

#### Netflix Bitrate

*URL: https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/22/24171581/netflix-bet-advanced-encoding-anne-aaron*

> Back in those days, a viewer on a very slow connection would automatically get a 240p stream with a bitrate of 235 kbps. Faster connections would receive a 1750 kbps 720p video; Netflix’s streaming quality topped out at 1080p with a 5800 kbps bitrate. 
> The company’s content delivery servers would automatically choose the best version for each viewer based on their device and broadband speeds and adjust the streaming quality on the fly to account for network slow-downs.

This is how I thought video streaming still worked. It turns out they've further optimized based on the video itself. For example, smoky scenes from the Crown might need a higher bitrate but animated shows might get by with a lower bitrate.

#### Leading a Software Migration

*URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40757486&utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

> - migrations always run longer than expected. In my case, leadership estimates were off by a factor of 10. What the eng manager originally said would take 3 months ended up taking a couple years.
> - try to deliver quick wins and incremental value. This is often hard though. But it’s worth a try.
> - Try to avoid this becoming the project everybody attaches their pet projects too. It’s too easy for people to make this the project where they use that new framework, test well, set up a design system, and make lots of little changes.
> - that being said: migrations are easiest if you keep the design (visually and engineering) exactly the same. There will be lots of pressure to “just redo it while you’re already having to rewrite it”, but the uncertainty of a redesign really slows things down. Having a reference implementation means you don’t have to invent tons of acceptance criteria from first principles.
> - as soon as things start getting delayed, which they will, try offering to cut corners or cancel the project. You want somebody else in corporate to stick their neck out to extend the project.
> - Try seeding the team with more veteran ICs internally. You’ll need their help as you uncover dragons or need to get other teams to help run or integrate your new code.
> - Among projects I’ve seen like this, the person running them gets fired or quits partway through at least half of the time. This is often because some middle manager made a promise they couldn’t keep to executives, and needs a scapegoat to save their own job. (It’s often that kind of middle manager who switches jobs every two years and keeps failing up silently and the project delay happens halfway through their stay at the company and they’re just trying to get to the two year mark and quit before anybody realizes what is going on internally.)

#### History of Frontend Build Systems

*URL: https://sunsetglow.net/posts/frontend-build-systems.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

Core idea: "Developers write JavaScript; browsers run JavaScript. Fundamentally, no build step is necessary in frontend development. So why do we have a build step in modern frontend?" Note that this is different from other languages like Java where it needs to go to Bytecode before it can be run on a JVM. 

- Frontend build systems emit one *distributable* which illegible to humans but better for the browser.

- Frontend build systems typically consist of three steps: transpilation, bundling, and minification.

- Transpilation: turns JSX (or other like TypeScript) into JavaScript. Examples: Babel, SWC, tsc
- Bundling solves the need to make many network requests because it concatenates multiple JS source files into a single output file. Example bunders: Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, Esbuild, Turbopack
  - Code splitting involves breaking the concatenated file into a few bundles to reduce bundle size (this is a tradeoff between network requests and hihg initial load times)
  - Tree shaking removes unused exports of modules to optimize bundle size, parsing time, and loading speeds.
  - Loaders allow importing of static assets from JS which unifies code and static assets into a single dependency graph.
- Minifiers reduce the size of the file without affecting behavior. Examples include shortening variable names, eliminating whitespace and comments, rjmoving dead code, etc.

- Meta-frameworks: curate a set of packages (example: Vite preconfigues a few systems together). These are suitable for generic frontend applications.

- Sourcemaps: map a distibutable back to original location in the source code.

Remember that CloudFormation is infra as code. CloudFormation has a library of over 1,250 resources so its hard to get started. Amazon Q is their AI assistant that can explain and generate CloudFormation templates.

#### Product Development Notes

*URL: https://medium.com/@hakanerdogan/10-important-notes-on-product-development-836a65b72a9d*

- Scaling teams: "It has 3 components, infrastructure, product, and team. The more parallel and autonomous you can make Swat teams, the larger tasks you can carry out simultaneously."
- Don't overengineer: " The main rule is that technology -> exists for the product, and the product -> exists for the people. It is difficult to make it simple, a flying bike is often not needed. As Voltaire said, the perfect is the enemy of the good."
- Best for code quality: "Pair Programming — Code Review — Test Driven Development"

#### Load Shedding at Netflix

*URL: https://netflixtechblog.com/enhancing-netflix-reliability-with-service-level-prioritized-load-shedding-e735e6ce8f7d*

- Load shedding at API gateway level. At Netflix the API gateway manages different network traffic.
- Interestingly Netflix does User-initiated requests of playing but also pre-fetch requeests while browsing to try to reduce play-time latency.

#### General vs Functional Management

*URL: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/general-management-functional-and?r=2bjtip&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=tldrwebdev&triedRedirect=true*

- Functional model: Engineering, product, and design triad leaders co-own product metrics.
- If North star metric is revenue then GM typically works better.
