#### React State

*URL: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1799435036736778364.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

In React, state can be managed using several methods: local state within a component using `useState` or class-based `setState`, context state for global state management across the component tree using `useContext` and `Context API`, and third-party state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or Recoil for more complex and scalable state management solutions. Local state is ideal for managing state within a single component, while context state is useful for sharing state across multiple components without prop drilling. Third-party libraries offer advanced features like middleware, actions, and reducers, making them suitable for larger applications with intricate state management needs.

*URL: https://hybridhacker.email/p/how-to-use-engineering-metrics?r=2bjtip&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=tldrwebdev&triedRedirect=true*

Delivery metrics are key performance indicators that measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the software delivery process. They include:

1. **Lead Time for Changes**: The time taken from the first commit of a feature to its deployment in production, indicating the speed of the development process.
2. **Release Frequency**: How often the organization deploys code, reflecting the agility of the release process.
3. **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**: The average time required to recover from a failure, showcasing the team's responsiveness and resilience.
4. **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that cause a failure in production, highlighting the stability and quality of the releases.

These metrics, popularized by the DORA framework, help organizations measure and improve their software delivery performance.

#### 12 Factor app

*URL: https://12factor.net*

12-factor app is a methodology for building SaaS. Should be declarative for setup (think Terraform). 
Should have a clean contract with OS (think containers or VM). 
Should be suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms.
Should minimize divergence between dev and prod to enable CD.
Can support scaling up without changes to tooling, architecture, or dev practices.
Notice that the programming language and services don't matter for these goals.
This paradigm can from the developers of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

##### Factor 1: Codebase

If there are multiple codebases than it's not an app but a distributed system. 
Each component in distributed system is an app and each can comply with twelve-factor.
One codebase per app. But there will be many deploys of an app.
A deploy is a running isntance of an app (typically a production or staging site).

##### Factor 2: Dependencies

Dependencies should be explicity declared and isolated.
- Think like lock files.

##### Factor 3: Config

Configs should be stored in the enviornment.
Configs are everything that is likely to vary between deploys (dev, staging, prod).
Config should be strictly separated from code.
Examples of configs: resource handles to the database, credentials to external services, per deploy values such as version number.

##### Factor 4: Backing services

Treat backing services as attached resources.
A backing service is any service consumed over the network
- Databases (MySQL or MariaDB)
- Messaging/queueing systems (RabbitMQ or Kafka)
- SMTP for example
- Caching such as Redis

##### Factor 5: Build, release, run

Build, release, run...
Strictly separate build and run stages.
- Build converts code into executable bundle known as a build
- Release takes build and combines with configs
Releases always have a unqiue release ID that cannot be mutated once created.
Any change should be a new release.

##### Factor 6: Processes

The app should be executed as one or more stateless processes. 
Apps should be stateless and share nothing. 
Any data that needs to persist should be stored in a stateful backing service (typically a database).
Sticky sesions are typically a bad idea and something like Memcached or Redis that offers time-expiration is more robust.

##### Factor 7: Port binding

Web apps are sometimes executed inside a webserver container (for example Java apps running inside Tomcat).
Web apps can export HTTp as a service by binding to a port.
You can inject the webserver library using dependency declaration (factor 2).

##### Factor 8: Concurrency

Scale out via the process model.
Processes should be first class citizens.
Individual applications can only grow so large (vertical scale) so at some point you will have to scale out.

##### Factor 9: Disposability

Processes should be disposable meaning they can stop or start at a moments notice.
This helps enable scaling up and scaling down (elasticity and scalability).
Try to minimize startup time.

##### Factor 10: Dev/prod parity

Keep dev, staging and prod as similar as possible.
Gaps manifest because of time gap, personnel gap (devs writing and ops deployingg), tools gap (different local vs prod stack).
Continuous deployment is better for keeping gap between dev and prod small.
Resist the urge to use different services between dev and prod.
Lightweight backing services like SQLite locally and PostgreSQL in prod is common but usually bad practice.

##### Factor 11: Logs

Logs should be treated as event streams.
Logs are the stream of aggregated, time-ordered events.
Each running process should write its event stream unbuffed to stdout.
Helpful for finding specific events, large-scale graphic of trends, active alerting.

##### Factor 12: Admin proccesses

Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes.

##### My thoughts

The 12 factor app is a nice starting paradigm. To me it seems a little outdated (I think it was written in 2011). For example, kubernetes handles small things like port bindings. Regardless, this seems like a good starting point for applications.

#### Python notebooks are bad

*URL: https://yobibyte.github.io/notebooks.html?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

Notebooks, while convenient, encourage bad practices, lack proper versioning and state management, and can lead to inefficiencies and distractions, ultimately hindering both individual productivity and team collaboration.

#### Programming and thinking

*URL: https://agileotter.blogspot.com/2014/09/programming-is-mostly-thinking.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

Because software production involves only electrons, its marginal cost is essentially zero, shifting the importance entirely to design. With an infinitely productive software factory, the primary focus would be on creating high-quality, well-thought-out designs rather than the physical act of coding itself.

#### What is Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

*URL: https://vercel.com/blog/demystifying-inp-new-tools-and-actionable-insights*

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a metric that became part of Googleâ€™s Core Web Vitals in March 2024, measuring the time from a user interaction to the next paint of the web page. It emphasizes providing feedback to the user within 200ms to acknowledge their input, rather than completing all rendering tasks within this timeframe. Optimizing INP involves minimizing delays caused by third-party JavaScript, shortening event handler phases through techniques like React's memoization, and helping the browser render efficiently using tools like CSS containment. Real-world strategies, such as those used on Vercel's websites, include splitting the user interaction response into acknowledgment and action phases, ensuring immediate feedback without compromising performance.

#### Decoupling to improve pushing at GitHub

*URL: https://github.blog/2024-06-11-how-we-improved-push-processing-on-github/?utm_source=blog.quastor.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-github-rebuilt-their-push-processing-system*

GitHub improved its push processing by decoupling a massive background job into multiple isolated, parallel jobs using Kafka events, resulting in lower latency, better observability, and more reliable processing. This new system reduces the blast radius of errors, allows better ownership of push tasks, and processes pushes more efficiently, handling nearly all push events without failures.

#### Sleep deprivation disrupts memory

*URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01732-y?utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

Sleep deprivation disrupts sharp-wave ripple activity in the hippocampus, which is crucial for memory formation, leading to weakened and less organized neural patterns even after subsequent normal sleep. This suggests a critical window for memory processing that, once missed, cannot be fully recovered, emphasizing the importance of continuous, quality sleep for effective memory consolidation. These findings could eventually inform treatments for memory-related conditions, potentially aiding in the management of traumatic memories in disorders like PTSD.

#### GenAI and more software engineers

*URL: https://roarepally.com/blog/ai-and-software-engineers?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

The article predicts that the demand for software engineers will increase over the next 20 years, driven by generative AI tools that enhance, rather than replace, traditional software engineering roles. This trend will make software engineering more accessible, creating more opportunities for innovation and increasing the need for top talent, while evolving the skill sets required in the field.

#### SaaS architecture (tons of automation)

*URL: https://anthonynsimon.com/blog/one-man-saas-architecture/?utm_source=tldrwebdev*

The article details the architecture and tools used by a one-person tech startup to run a SaaS application, highlighting the use of Kubernetes on AWS for managing infrastructure. The author emphasizes the importance of automation, reliability, and scalability, achieved through tools like Terraform, Flux, and Prometheus for version-controlled infrastructure, automated deployments, and monitoring. The setup includes managed services like Postgres and ClickHouse for data storage, Redis for caching, and Celery for scheduled tasks, all orchestrated within a Kubernetes cluster. The author stresses the benefits of a highly automated and resilient infrastructure, allowing minimal time spent on management and more on development. The article serves as a practical guide for software engineers interested in leveraging modern DevOps practices to efficiently manage and scale their own projects.

#### Back to On-prem

*URL: https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0*

Basecamp is leaving the cloud because they find it cost-ineffective and unnecessarily complex for their stable, medium-sized operations, preferring to manage their own servers for better control and lower costs. 
> "The cloud excels at two ends of the spectrum, where only one end was ever relevant for us. The first end is when your application is so simple and low traffic that you really do save on complexity by starting with fully managed services. This is the shining path that Heroku forged, and the one that has since been paved by Render and others. It remains a fabulous way to get started when you have no customers, and it'll carry you quite far even once you start having some."
> "The second is when your load is highly irregular. When you have wild swings or towering peaks in usage. When the baseline is a sliver of your largest needs. Or when you have no idea whether you need ten servers or a hundred."
> "Now the argument always goes: Sure, but you have to manage these machines! The cloud is so much simpler! The savings will all be there in labor costs! Except no. Anyone who thinks running a major service like HEY or Basecamp in the cloud is "simple" has clearly never tried. Some things are simpler, others more complex, but on the whole, I've yet to hear of organizations at our scale being able to materially shrink their operations team, just because they moved to the cloud."

#### Benefits of on-prem

*URL: https://zwischenzugs.com/2024/06/18/ok-cloud-on-prem-is-alright/?utm_source=tldrdevops*

TLDR; cloud is really expensive and sometimes running own servers is cheaper

In recent years, businesses have shifted from a wholesale cloud migration strategy to a more hybrid approach, keeping some workloads on-premises and moving others to the cloud only when necessary. This change is driven by factors such as migration fatigue, hardware costs, and macroeconomic trends, leading to a slowdown in cloud adoption growth. As cloud spend continues to rise, albeit more slowly, the emphasis is on ensuring software workloads are portable and can run efficiently across different environments, whether in the cloud or on-premises.

#### Finance department and IT

*URL: https://blog.container-solutions.com/to-transform-it-start-with-finance*

Finance often gets in the way of software development because finance sets budgets and engineers have to work with the budget constraint first and foremost.

> "Yearly accounting cycles make a mockery of technical teamsâ€™ attempts to be truly â€˜Agileâ€™ in response to business demand. If a released MVP product flies off the shelf in February, then you canâ€™t get funding to scale it up until January next year."

Basically [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) or that communication between teams is reflected to the product.

#### Budgetting and Agile development

*URL: https://blog.container-solutions.com/money-flows-part-iii-youre-only-as-agile-as-your-budget*

> "youâ€™re only as Agile as your budget"

SpaceX's product management approach prioritizes rapid innovation and agility by emphasizing real-time budgeting, decentralized decision-making, and alignment of organizational structure to product needs, rather than adhering to traditional project management norms like fixed budgets and deadlines. This methodology allows SpaceX to innovate quickly and efficiently, demonstrating that financial agility is crucial for achieving organizational agility and maintaining a competitive edge.

#### 10x vs 1x work

*URL: https://andrewchen.substack.com/p/10x-work-versus-1x-work?utm_source=tldrnewsletter*

The essay argues against the rigid routines and "hustle culture" often promoted for achieving success, instead advocating for embracing serendipity and high-impact work, termed "10x work." It suggests that significant career achievements come from pivotal, unpredictable moments rather than from perfecting daily habits. The author emphasizes the importance of creating environments where such high-impact opportunities can emerge, focusing on agency, risk, and new information. As Scott Adams writes, "Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable," advocating for becoming exceptional in a unique combination of skills.

### Things I should learn more about

- It would be good to have a better idea of how infrastructure works. Terraform and AWS would be a good starting point.
