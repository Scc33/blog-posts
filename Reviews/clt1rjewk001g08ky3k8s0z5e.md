Through the fictional yet relatable journey of an IT manager thrust into the chaos of a failing department, this novel explores the transformative power of [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) principles in addressing common yet complex business and technical challenges.

## The Story Begins in Chaos

Imagine stepping into a world where every technological system you rely on is hanging by a thread, where the thin line between success and disaster is a daily battle.

## Quotes

Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:

* “you need to create what Humble and Farley called a deployment pipeline. That’s your entire value stream from code check-in to production. That’s not an art. That’s production. You need to get everything in version control. Everything. Not just the code, but everything required to build the environment. Then you need to automate the entire environment creation process. You need a deployment pipeline where you can create test and production environments, and then deploy code into them, entirely on-demand. That’s how you reduce your setup times and eliminate errors, so you can finally match whatever rate of change Development sets the tempo at.” (Page 347)
    
* “In these competitive times, the name of the game is quick time to market and to fail fast." (Page 307)
    
* “Every work center is made up of four things: the machine, the man, the method, and the measures." (Page 243)
    
* "Four types of it Operations work: business projects, it Operations projects, changes, and unplanned work." (Page 222)
    
* “The First Way helps us understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into it Operations, because that’s what’s between the business and the customer. The Second Way shows us how to shorten and amplify feedback loops, so we can fix quality at the source and avoid rework. And the Third Way shows us how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.” (Page 103)
    
* “Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt, who created the Theory of Constraints, showed us how any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion. Astonishing, but true! Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless, because it will always remain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck. And any improvements made before the bottleneck merely results in more inventory piling up at the bottleneck.” (Page 102)
