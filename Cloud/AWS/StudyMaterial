Lambda and ECR,must implement Lambda runtime API, cannot support multi-architecture container images
EBS confinement,EBS is locked to an availability zone
How to auto deploy on AWS,AWS CodeDeploy
How to manage Lambda Latency bottlenecks?,configure application auto scaling to manage Lambda provisioned concurrency
CLI --dry-run,checks if you have required permissions for an action
API Gateway Auth options,- Cognito User Pools
- IAM Roles & Policies
- Lambda Authorizer
S3 Multipart Upload,- improves throughput
- can pause and resume
- supports network recovery
- recommended for large (over 100 MB) uploads

EB All at once deploys,- deploys new app version to all instances at the same time
- fastest type of Elastic Beanstalk deploy
- create some amount of downtime
RCU Strong Consistent,- one strongly consistent read per second

1) round data up to nearest 4
2) divide by 4
3) times by # of reads

SSE-C
- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer_alg
- x-amz-server-side-encryption
- x-amz-server-side-encryption-MD5

- resources running in AWS that need programmatic access

User
- running outside of AWS and always need access to keys

KMS Data Encryption Flow,1) GenerateDataKey API call
2) Use plaintext to encrypt locally and erase plaintext from memory
3) Store encrypted data key
S3 Bucket Policy,JSON document that allows for complex access control to buck (think of as IAM for S3)
App Mesh,fully managed service mesh for microservice communication
DynamoDB Streams,Lambda function that runs every DynamoDB data modification (update, create, delete)
DynamoDB Strong vs Eventual Consistency,Eventual - data is returned immediately but can be out of data
Strong - will read from reader so will always be accurate but has higher latency
