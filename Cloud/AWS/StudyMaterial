AWS Glue Data Catalog,Apache Hive Metastore - compatible data service
AWS Glue,serverless data integration service
AWS Lake Formation,is a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that
stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis.
Data Lake,a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its original format until the business needs it
Data Storage Progression,Lake is the largest and long term, Warehouse is middle, Database is the smallest and fastest
AWS Data Exchange,catalogue for sharing data from third party sources
Amazon Neptune,graph database that contains other services like Neptune Analytics for running graph analytics and NeptuneML for predictions with graph data
AWS Audit Manager,audit risk/compliance, supports frameworks like PCI/HIPPA, library of controls
Amazon DocumentDB,NoSQL document database that is MongoDB compaitble
Amazon DocumentDB types,Instance based (you manage instances directly), Elastic cluster (auto scales)
CloudFormation Intrinsic vs Pseudo,Intrinsic are available CloudFormation functions whereas Pseudo are build in parameters
CloudFormation Pseudo Parameters,built in parameters auto provided by CloudFormation like AWS::AccoundId or AWS::Region
CDK vs CloudFormation,CDK is imperative and written in code whereas CloudFormation is declarative and describes everything
CloudFront Signed Cookie vs Signed URL,Signed url takes precedent however signed cookie can be used for when you don't want to change the url
Lambda and ECR,must implement Lambda runtime API, cannot support multi-architecture container images
EBS confinement,EBS is locked to an availability zone
How to auto deploy on AWS,AWS CodeDeploy
How to manage Lambda Latency bottlenecks?,configure application auto scaling to manage Lambda provisioned concurrency
CLI --dry-run,checks if you have required permissions for an action
API Gateway Auth options,- Cognito User Pools
- IAM Roles & Policies
- Lambda Authorizer
S3 Multipart Upload,- improves throughput
- can pause and resume
- supports network recovery
- recommended for large (over 100 MB) uploads
NAT Gateway,A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Internet.
SQS Long vs Short Polling,- Long polling - wait for messages to arrive or timeout before returning
- Short polling - returns immediately or empty response
EB All at once deploys,- deploys new app version to all instances at the same time
- fastest type of Elastic Beanstalk deploy
- create some amount of downtime
RCU Strong Consistent,- one strongly consistent read per second

1) round data up to nearest 4
2) divide by 4
3) times by # of reads
S3 Encryption headers,SSE-S3 - x-amz-server-side-encryption

SSE-C
- x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer_alg
- x-amz-server-side-encryption
- x-amz-server-side-encryption-MD5
When to user IAM roles vs IAM User Credentials,IAM roles
- resources running in AWS that need programmatic access

User
- running outside of AWS and always need access to keys
API Gateway Timeout,29 seconds for REST/HTTP
- on timeout will return 504 Gateway Timeout error
KMS Data Encryption Flow,1) GenerateDataKey API call
2) Use plaintext to encrypt locally and erase plaintext from memory
3) Store encrypted data key
S3 Bucket Policy,JSON document that allows for complex access control to buck (think of as IAM for S3)
App Mesh,fully managed service mesh for microservice communication
DynamoDB Streams,Lambda function that runs every DynamoDB data modification (update, create, delete)
DynamoDB Strong vs Eventual Consistency,Eventual - data is returned immediately but can be out of data
Strong - will read from reader so will always be accurate but has higher latency
DynamoDB LSI vs GSI,- LSI - strong or eventual consistency, created on table initialization

- GSI - can be added any time, eventually consistent, preferred option
IAM Hierarchy,User
Group --> User
Role --> App
DynamoDB On-demand capacity,- Good for new or unpredictable workloads
- Default max of 40k RCU/WCU
DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX),Fully managed in memory write through cache for DynamoDB with eventual consistency
- Reduces latency
DyanmoDB Accelerator (DAX) Pros and Cons,Good for
- fast response times
- read intensive apps
- small items accessed a lot

Bad for
- can't strongly consistently read
- write intensive apps
- Consider Elasticache instead for more robustness
CMK,Customer Master Key
Use of CMKs,- primary resource of KMS
- used to encrypt / decrypt data keys not used for data directly)
Step Functions,- makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.
- are a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your application.
Step functions mnemonic,Think of as a flow chart
Step function use cases,- Manage batch jobs
- ETL jobs
- Transfer data records
- Transcoding
Step functions purpose,Coordinate workflows into a state machine
SSE-KMS,*Server Side Encryption at rest with AWS Key Management Service*
__________ provides an audit trail, so you can see who used your key to access which object and when, as well as view failed attempts to access data from users without permission to decrypt the data.
SSE-KMS description,Envelope encryption via KMS & you manage the keys
X-Ray Daemon,- Runs of UDP port 2000
- Collects data and passes to API
- Must be installed and can be used on-premises
SSE-C,*Server Side Encryption at rest with Customer Provided Keys*
SSE-C Drawbacks,Customer provides key
- Most private but data is gone if you lose the key
AWS Secret Manager,Easily rotate & retrieve DB/API/secrets
- Key value pairs
- Think of Vault
RCU Eventual Consistency Algorithm,two eventually consistent reads per second
1) round data to nearest 4
2) divide by 4
3) times by # of reads
4) divide final number by 2
5) round up to nearest whole number
IAM Role,IAM Entity that is very similar to a user, with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.
IAM Entity that does not have any credentials (password or access keys) associated with it.
IAM Entity that Instead of being uniquely associated with one person, is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
IAM Role,an identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions
- Credentials given with STS
WCU Algorithm,represents one write per second up to 1kB

1) round to nearest 1kB
2) times by number of writes
DynamoDB Transactions Properties,-Any scenario question that mentions ACID requirements, think DynamoDB Transactions (DDB-T)
-DDB-T provide developers with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability across 1 or more tables within a single AWS account and region
-All or nothing transactions
DynamoDB Transactions,Transactions are ACID
- TransactWriteItems
- TransactGetItems
DynamoDB Keys,Partition Key (or HASH)
Sort key ( or RANGE)
Simple = partition
Composite = partition + sort
STS,Security token service
STS uses,Provides temporary credentials required to assume IAM role
EC2 Instance Types,General Purpose
Compute Optimized
Memory Optimized
Accelerated Computing
Storage Optimized
Cognito User Pool,Used to connect to identity providers
- Sign-in, login functionality
- It's used for people
- Use for web/mobile apps
