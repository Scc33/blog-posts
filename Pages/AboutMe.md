### My Development Journey

My passion for software development began in a high school class and has been a guiding light ever since. I started with [Alice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(software)), an introductory programming environment.

Despite the unusual start, this initial spark led me to pursue computer science in college, paving the way for a fulfilling career in the field.

### My Career in a Nutshell

My programming expertise spans a diverse array of languages and frameworks, showcasing my versatility and adaptability in the ever-evolving software development landscape. I've delved into Java, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and Haskell, each adding a unique dimension to my coding skills.

In frontend development, I've crafted engaging user interfaces using frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and Django. On the backend, I've worked with Express and Spring Boot, enabling me to build robust and scalable server-side applications.

While I don't claim to be an expert in any single technology—it takes a lifetime to master even one—I cherish the breadth of my coding journey and the rich software engineering ecosystem I've explored. Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences and insights.

### My Non-Technical Passions

Outside of technology, I have a wide range of hobbies that bring me joy and balance. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, weight lifting, hiking, running, reading, traveling, gardening, and cooking. Like many, I wish I had more hours in the day to pursue all my interests, but I make the most of the time I have.
