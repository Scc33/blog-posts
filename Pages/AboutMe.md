### My development start

My passion for software development ignited in a high school class and has been a guiding light ever since. I learned on a positively ancient program called [Alice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_(software)) if you can believe it. 

Regardless of the strange start, the initial spark led me to pursue computer science at the collegiate level and has paved the way for a fulfilling career in the field.

### My brief career

My programming expertise is a tapestry woven from a rich variety of languages and frameworks, reflecting my versatility and adaptability in the ever-evolving landscape of software development. As a developer, I have delved deeply into Java, Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and Haskell, each language adding a unique dimension to my coding repertoire. 

My proficiency extends to an array of frontend frameworks, including React, Angular, Vue, and Django, where I have adeptly crafted engaging and responsive user interfaces. 

In the realm of backend development, I have dabbled with the Express and Spring Boot frameworks, enabling me to architect robust and scalable server-side applications. 

I don't claim to be an expert in any of these technologies. It takes an entire career to learn any one of these and I am just getting started with my career. However, while I am not an expert, I appreciate that my coding journey has taken me to a variety of technologies. 

I'm honored to have seen some of what the rich software engineering ecosystem has to share. I hope to use this blog to share some of my experiences.

### My non-technical passions

Beyond the confines of technology, I find solace and rejuvenation in a variety of hobbies (really I have way too many hobbies). In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, weight lifting, hiking running, reading whatever I can get my hands on, traveling, gardening, and cooking. I wish I had more free time or more hours in the day, but don't we all.
