## Introduction

Lately, I've started using [Dall·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) and its [integration into ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-3-is-now-available-in-chatgpt-plus-and-enterprise) to create cover art for my posts. I used to use code screens, Giphy images, or nothing at all because I'm not a very artistic person.

GPT has opened up a whole new avenue of creativity for me. I think these AI-generated pieces have been making my posts a little more creative and far more unique.

In the spirit of generative AI, I asked GPT to write its own explanation of how to use it. The prompts were created by me but the text and image output you see are from the bot.

Now, without further ado, here is the blog post explaining how to create artwork for your posts using GPT.

## GPT's Intro (it is pretty formulaic)

> Welcome to my latest blog post, where we dive into an exciting feature of ChatGPT – the ability to create images! If you've ever wished for a tool that could bring your ideas to life visually, then you're in for a treat. In this post, we'll explore how ChatGPT, with its integration of Dalle, can transform your descriptions into vivid, detailed images. Whether it's for creative projects, conceptual visualization, or just for fun, you'll see how effortlessly ChatGPT can turn your imagination into stunning visuals. Let's embark on this creative journey together and unlock the potential of AI-powered image generation!

## Example Image Creation Process with GPT

> **User**: Hi! I want an image created using Dalle that looks like a futuristic cityscape at dusk, with flying cars and neon lights, sized at 1600x840.
> 
> **ChatGPT**: Sure thing! I'll create an image of a futuristic cityscape at dusk for you. This city will have flying cars zipping through the sky and buildings illuminated with neon lights. The size will be 1600x840. Just a moment while I work on this.
> 
> \[ChatGPT processes the request and generates the image\]
> 
> **ChatGPT**: Here's your image! It captures a bustling, futuristic city at dusk, complete with flying cars and vibrant neon lights. Is there anything else you'd like to add or change in this image?

It's that simple! Now you'll have cool-looking artwork to incorporate. Two notes:

1. This currently requires a pro subscription to ChatGPT.
    
2. The images are generated as PNGs with huge file sizes (I'd recommend exporting into something more efficient like JPEG).
    

## Dall·E Examples

I bet you wanted to see some examples ;).
