### Site Background

Who am I announcing this to? I'm not sure. It's a total vanity project, but we all need a vanity project or two!

I originally published my site [seancoughlin. me](https://seancoughlin.me) around two years ago. At the time, I used a basic [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) resume template. I used raw HTML and CSS with a little plain JS.

I filled out my details, deployed to Github pages, and called it a day. The page saw a few content updates, some under-the-hood optimizations for SEO and [Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk), and the addition of minor UI tweaks like [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons.

Things were fine, but I felt the site had started to feel dated and didn't reflect my current skills. So I went on the hunt for new ideas.

### Finding Inspiration

I am an engineer by trade and CS geek by night. As hard as I try, graphic design just isn't my strong suit. However, people are kind and open-source is awesome! If you ever lack inspiration, search out the community. Just remember to cite the helpful people who contribute to your work :).

After some hunting, I arrived at [this](https://youtu.be/-2UjwQzxvBQ?si=9q7kHikpHbCoVqaG) cool [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) tutorial! This guy was great a great teacher and I learned a lot from this tutorial. I typically work with React so this was my first [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) introduction. I would say this is a good place to start.

I took his great design and made some tweaks such as adding my details, a skills section, and custom links.

If you want to check out the original tutorial code you can find it [here](https://github.com/jamezmca/hughjass). If you want to check out my source code you can find that [here](https://github.com/Scc33/Scc33.github.io/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
