## Introduction

In the Spring of 2024, I embarked on a journey through the world of data mining by enrolling in [CS 412](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs412) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This course promised a comprehensive exploration of the main functions of data mining: pattern discovery, cluster analysis, and classification, each of which plays a pivotal role in extracting knowledge from vast amounts of data.

## Course Overview

CS 412 is designed to introduce students to the essential concepts, principles, methods, and applications of data mining. The course breaks down into three major sections—pattern discovery, cluster analysis, and classification—each delving into different algorithms and methodologies crucial for data analysis. The course is structured around a series of lecture videos, quizzes, programming assignments, and proctored exams, aiming to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

The curriculum is based on the latest edition of the textbook "Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques" and also incorporates materials and methodologies from the on-campus version of the course. It’s structured to offer an in-depth look at each of the three main data mining functions, supplemented by real-world applications and enhanced learning through hands-on programming tasks.

### Course Structure and Content

The course unfolds through a well-organized framework similar to the other MCS courses.

* **Lecture Videos:** Weekly videos introduce key concepts, complemented by downloadable slides for offline review.
    
* **In-Video Questions:** Embedded within the videos to gauge comprehension, these questions are informative but not graded (these often appeared on the exams).
    
* **Lesson Quizzes:** These are conducted weekly with no time limit and unlimited attempts, covering a wide range of topics to ensure mastery of the material. The highest score from these quizzes counts towards the final grade (basically participation credit as you can take as many times as you want).
    
* **Programming Assignments:** Seven assignments distributed throughout the term encourage hands-on practice in the three main areas of data mining. These assignments are critical for applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
    
* **Proctored Exams:** Three exams, one for each part of the course, are conducted online. Despite being proctored through ProctorU—a system I found invasive—these exams are a significant component of the assessment process.
    

### Grading Distribution

* Lesson Quizzes + Orientation Quiz: 20.8%
    
* Programming Assignments: 34.65%
    
* Individual Exams on each course part: 14.85% each, totaling 44.55% (these are not cumulative)
    

## Personal Takeaways and Challenges

Professor Han’s expertise provided an invaluable learning experience, though the course’s rigor was balanced with a fair grading system and immediate feedback through auto graders. The professor [ranks at #3](https://research.com/scientists-rankings/computer-science) in the world on citations and it is quite cool to be taught by such a renowned expert.

The allowance of a double-sided cheat sheet during exams was particularly helpful, not just for the tests but also as a study aid.

While the pattern discovery section was more theoretical, the parts on cluster analysis and classification were engaging and offered more practical skills applicable to real-world problems. However, the course content seems slightly outdated as it has not been revised to include the latest advancements in AI and data mining, such as ChatGPT or newer transformer models beyond GPT-2.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on my experience with CS 412, I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in data mining, particularly those who appreciate a mix of theory and practical application.

Although the use of ProctorU was a downside, the overall design and execution of the course, combined with the opportunity to learn from a leading expert, outweigh this minor gripe. For software engineers like myself who aren’t deeply entrenched in data work but wish to expand their skill set, this course provides substantial value.
