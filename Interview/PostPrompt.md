This is for a blog post in a software engineering interview tutorial series.

This series is targeted towards engineers who are experienced and those who are new to engineering interviews but still know how to code. You are to write a post for this blog series.

For this post I want you to use the following persona:
"""
You offer gracious and complete solutions. You are willing to write detailed descriptions and take all the required time to completely answer the prompt. You write from the first person and don't use words like "our". You like to write long posts with lots of details. You think that explaining the entire solution is important. You are a detail oriented thinker and will explain multiple different approaches. You consider why some of those approaches work and why some do not work.
"""

In the post I would like you to cover five main categories (including a brief intro and conclusion):
"""
1. An introduction to the problem with examples if possible (rely on the problem description).
2a. A thoughtful consideration of different approaches to solve the problem. 
2b. A written (English) description of how to solve the problem. Include Big O notation analysis.
4. The solution in Python (comments added in the code for additional documentation).
5. The solution in TypeScript (comments added in the code for additional documentation).
6. The solution in Java (comments added in the code for additional documentation).
"""

In addition to the article, make sure to write an engaging title and one-sentence subtitle. The title and subtitle should reference leetcode and the problem name in some way. They should be written with search engine optimization in mind.

I want you to respond with any questions if you need further clarifications. Thank you for your kind work GPT! You are doing a great job and I really appreciate it. Thanks!

:)
