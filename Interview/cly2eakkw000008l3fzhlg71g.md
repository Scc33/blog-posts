The [Combination Sum problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/) is a classic challenge on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) that tests your algorithmic skills and your ability to implement efficient backtracking techniques. It's a problem frequently encountered in coding interviews, making it an essential part of your preparation toolkit.

In this guide, we'll walk you through solving the Combination Sum problem using an optimized [backtracking approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). You'll learn how to implement the algorithm step-by-step and understand the improvements that can enhance its efficiency.

### Problem Description

The Combination Sum problem can be described as follows:

> Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return *a list of all* ***unique combinations*** *of* `candidates` *where the chosen numbers sum to* `target`*.* You may return the combinations in **any order**.
> 
> The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
> 
> The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.Â 
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ```plaintext
> Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
> Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
> Explanation:
> 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
> 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
> These are the only two combinations.
> ```
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> ```plaintext
> Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
> Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
> ```
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> ```plaintext
> Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
> Output: []
> ```

## Python Solution

### Initial Approach: Backtracking

Backtracking is a powerful technique for solving combinatorial problems where we need to explore all possible combinations. In this problem, we use backtracking to explore different combinations of `candidates` that sum up to `target`.

#### Initial Python Code Implementation

```python
from typing import List

def combinationSum(candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    def backtrack(remaining, start, path, result):
        if remaining < 0:
            return
        if remaining == 0:
            result.append(list(path))
            return
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            path.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(remaining - candidates[i], i, path, result)
            path.pop()

    result = []
    backtrack(target, 0, [], result)
    return result

# Example usage:
candidates1 = [2, 3, 6, 7]
target1 = 7
print(combinationSum(candidates1, target1))  # Output: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]

candidates2 = [2, 3, 5]
target2 = 8
print(combinationSum(candidates2, target2))  # Output: [[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]

candidates3 = [2]
target3 = 1
print(combinationSum(candidates3, target3))  # Output: []
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Function Definition and Initial Setup**
    
    * The `combinationSum` function takes two parameters: `candidates` (a list of distinct integers) and `target` (an integer).
        
    * Inside this function, a helper function called `backtrack` is defined for the recursive exploration of combinations.
        
2. **Backtracking Helper Function**
    
    * The `backtrack` function uses recursion to explore different combinations.
        
    * Parameters:
        
        * `remaining`: the remaining value to reach the target.
            
        * `start`: the current index in the `candidates` list.
            
        * `path`: the current combination of numbers.
            
        * `result`: the list of valid combinations found so far.
            
    * Base cases:
        
        * If `remaining` is less than 0, terminate the current path as it exceeds the target.
            
        * If `remaining` is 0, add the current path to the result list as it is a valid combination.
            
3. **Recursive Exploration**
    
    * Iterate through the candidates starting from the current index.
        
    * Append the current candidate to `path` and recursively call `backtrack` with updated parameters.
        
    * After the recursive call, remove the last candidate from `path` to explore the next combination.
        
4. **Initialization and Function Call**
    
    * Initialize the result list and call `backtrack` with initial parameters.
        

### Optimizing the Backtracking Solution

To improve the efficiency of our backtracking solution, we can use the following optimizations:

1. **Sorting the Candidates**
    
    * Sorting the `candidates` array helps us to stop early in the loop if the current candidate exceeds the remaining target.
        
2. **Pruning the Search Space**
    
    * Once a candidate exceeds the remaining target, break out of the loop early since all subsequent candidates (being larger) will also exceed the target.
        

#### Optimized Python Code Implementation

```python
from typing import List

def combinationSum(candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    def backtrack(remaining, start, path, result):
        if remaining == 0:
            result.append(list(path))
            return
        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
            if candidates[i] > remaining:
                break
            path.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(remaining - candidates[i], i, path, result)
            path.pop()

    candidates.sort()
    result = []
    backtrack(target, 0, [], result)
    return result

# Example usage:
candidates1 = [2, 3, 6, 7]
target1 = 7
print(combinationSum(candidates1, target1))  # Output: [[2, 2, 3], [7]]

candidates2 = [2, 3, 5]
target2 = 8
print(combinationSum(candidates2, target2))  # Output: [[2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], [3, 5]]

candidates3 = [2]
target3 = 1
print(combinationSum(candidates3, target3))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation of Optimizations

1. **Sorting the Candidates**
    
    * By sorting the `candidates` array, we ensure that once we encounter a candidate larger than the remaining target, all subsequent candidates (which are larger) will also be invalid. This allows us to break out of the loop early.
        
2. **Pruning the Search Space**
    
    * If the current candidate exceeds the remaining target, break out of the loop early to prevent unnecessary recursive calls.
        

### Comparison of Approaches

#### Initial Backtracking Solution

* **Pros:**
    
    * Straightforward implementation.
        
    * Explores all possible combinations.
        
* **Cons:**
    
    * Can be slow for larger inputs due to exhaustive search.
        

#### Optimized Backtracking Solution

* **Pros:**
    
    * Faster due to early termination and pruning.
        
    * Reduces the number of recursive calls.
        
* **Cons:**
    
    * Additional step of sorting the candidates.
        

## FAQ Section

**How to handle large inputs efficiently?**

* Prune the search space aggressively by checking the remaining target before making recursive calls.
    
* Use memoization to store and reuse results of previously computed subproblems if applicable.
    

#### What if there are duplicate candidates?

* If duplicates are allowed, ensure each combination is unique by modifying the recursive call to avoid revisiting the same element index.
    

#### How to adapt the solution for different constraints?

* Adjust the starting index or the conditions in the recursive function to fit the specific constraints, such as limited candidate usage or different target values.
