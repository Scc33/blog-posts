As a software engineer, preparing for technical interviews and staying up-to-date with the latest system design techniques is crucial to staying ahead of the game and landing your next job. In this blogging series, I'm going to dive into software engineering interview preparation and system design, covering everything from foundational data structures and algorithms to more advanced distributed systems concepts.

Throughout the series, I'll be exploring a variety of Leetcode problems and discussing the most effective approaches to solving them. I'll also be sharing my favorite books and online resources for studying, providing you with the tools you need to excel in your next interview.

In addition to interview preparation, I'll also be delving into the fascinating world of system design. I'll be breaking down complex concepts and discussing real-world examples, giving you a better understanding of how to design scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

As a software engineer with a couple of years of experience, a bachelor's and a master's degree in computer science, and a general passion for all things nerdy, maybe you would expect me to be good at this stuff. In fact, I've always struggled with this side of software engineering. My goal in writing this series is to *learn in the open*. I am writing this series while I embark on my journey of learning more. I'm hoping to keep myself engaged with learning, and maybe I can teach a potential reader a thing or two as well.

You can find the series at [https://blog.seancoughlin.me/series/interview-prep](https://blog.seancoughlin.me/series/interview-prep).

Let's get started.
