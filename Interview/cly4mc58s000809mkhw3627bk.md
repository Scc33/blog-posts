## Solving the Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree on LeetCode

## Introduction

[Finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/) of two nodes in a binary tree is a classic problem often encountered in coding interviews and algorithm studies. Understanding how to solve this problem not only improves your problem-solving skills but also deepens your understanding of binary trees and recursive algorithms.

In this article, we will explore the problem, discuss a recursive approach to solving it, and implement the solution in Python.

### Understanding the Problem

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
> 
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)r is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T`that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

> 
> ```plaintext
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

> 
> ```plaintext
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
> Output: 5
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
> ```
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> ```plaintext
> Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
> Output: 1
> ```
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
>     
> * `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
>     
> * All `Node.val` are **unique**.
>     
> * `p != q`
>     
> * `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Recursive Depth-First Search Approach

To solve the problem, we can use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

#### Base Case

The base case of the recursion checks if the current node is `None`. If it is, we return `None`, indicating that we have reached the end of a branch without finding `p` or `q`.

#### Match Case

If the current node is either `p` or `q`, we return the current node. This indicates that we have found one of the nodes we are looking for.

#### Recursive Search

We recursively search the left and right subtrees of the current node. If both left and right recursive calls return non-`None` values, it means `p` and `q` are found in different subtrees, making the current node the LCA. If only one of the recursive calls returns a non-`None` value, it means both `p` and `q` are located in the same subtree, and we return the non-`None` result.

### Implementing the Solution in Python

Here’s the Python implementation of the recursive DFS approach:

```python
from typing import Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: Optional['TreeNode'] = None, right: Optional['TreeNode'] = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # Base case: if root is None, there's no LCA
        if not root:
            return None
        
        # If the current node is either p or q, return it
        if root == p or root == q:
            return root
        
        # Recursively search the left and right subtrees
        left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        
        # If both left and right are non-None, current node is the LCA
        if left and right:
            return root
        
        # Otherwise, return non-None value from left or right
        return left if left else right
```

### Explanation of the Code

* **Base Case**: The check `if not root` ensures we return `None` if the current node is `None`, indicating the end of a branch.
    
* **Match Case**: The check `if root == p or root == q` returns the current node if it matches either `p` or `q`.
    
* **Recursive Search**: The recursive calls `left = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)` and `right = self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)` search for `p` and `q` in the left and right subtrees.
    
* **Determine LCA**: The check `if left and right` returns the current node as the LCA if both recursive calls are non-`None`. Otherwise, it returns the non-`None` result from the left or right subtree.
    

#### Edge Cases and Considerations

* If `p` and `q` are the same node, the algorithm correctly returns that node as the LCA.
    
* The solution assumes that both `p` and `q` exist in the tree, as specified in the problem constraints.
    

## FAQ Section

#### What is the time complexity of the solution?

The time complexity of the solution is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm may need to traverse all the nodes in the tree.

#### Can this solution be adapted for a non-binary tree?

Yes, the solution can be adapted for a non-binary tree. However, the recursive search would need to be modified to iterate over all children of a node instead of just left and right children.

#### What are some common mistakes to avoid?

* Not handling the case where one of the nodes is `None`.
    
* Assuming that the nodes `p` and `q` are always different and exist in the tree without checking for it.
    

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing the Lowest Common Ancestor problem in a binary tree is a valuable exercise in recursive problem-solving and binary tree traversal. By using a recursive depth-first search approach, we can efficiently find the LCA of two nodes, ensuring our solution is both correct and optimal.
