## Introduction

In the dynamic field of software engineering, various [testing methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) play a crucial role in delivering reliable and efficient software products.

Among these methodologies, [system testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing) stands out as a pivotal phase in the software development life cycle.

This blog post aims to elucidate what system testing is, providing a clear understanding of its purpose and process.

## What is System Testing?

System testing is a high-level software testing process where a complete and integrated software system is tested.

The primary goal of system testing is to evaluate the system's compliance with requirements.

It is typically conducted after the integration testing phase and before the software is delivered for user acceptance testing.

This form of testing is crucial because it verifies and validates both the application's functional and non-functional requirements.

It encompasses a series of different tests to ensure that all the components of the system work together as intended.

These tests include, but are not limited to, performance testing, security testing, usability testing, and compliance testing.

I like to think of system testing as more of an umbrella term that captures lots of different testing forms.

### Characteristics of System Testing:

* **Holistic Approach:** It views the software as a whole rather than focusing on its individual components.
    
* **End-to-End Testing Scenario:** It involves testing the application in an environment that closely simulates or is real-world use.
    
* **Requirement Verification:** It checks if the system meets the predefined requirements and specifications.
    
* **Non-Functional Testing:** It includes testing aspects like performance, security, and usability, which go beyond mere functionality.
    
* **Multiple stakeholders:** It typically involves multiple stakeholders who all have a vested interest in some part of the system.
    

## Example of System Testing

To illustrate, let's consider an e-commerce website. System testing for such a website would involve:

* **Functional Testing:** Ensuring all features like product search, shopping cart functionality, payment processing, and order management work correctly together.
    
* **Performance Testing:** Testing how the website performs under different levels of user load, ensuring it can handle peak shopping times.
    
* **Security Testing:** Verifying that customer data is securely handled and that the website is robust against cyber threats.
    
* **Usability Testing:** Ensuring the website is user-friendly and accessible across various devices and browsers.
    

This comprehensive testing ensures that the e-commerce website operates efficiently, securely, and reliably in a real-world scenario.

These tests of the example e-commerce site would likely include automated tests and human verification.

For example, performance tests are typically automated to create load. However, usability tests are typically done manually by stakeholders like developers, designers, and product owners.

## Conclusion

In summary, system testing is an integral and comprehensive testing phase in software engineering, focused on evaluating a complete system to ensure it meets specified requirements and functions effectively in the real world.

By conducting system testing, software engineers can identify and rectify any issues before the software product is released, thereby enhancing the quality and reliability of the final product.
